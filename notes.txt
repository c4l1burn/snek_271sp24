Fork() (presumably)

Fcntl() stands for file control

Fork() creates a child process by duplicating the calling process. The original is called the "parent process"
pid_t fork(void);
----
int main()
{
	if(fork()) 
	{
	print("elder process");
	} else {
	print("child process");
	}
	return 0 ;
}
  this works because fork() returns the pid for the parent and 0 for the child process
  ## Sample code on the slide using fork is the better way to do something once every (some amount of time)


The even better way to do that is with pthreads. Unfortunately I zoned out by this point
